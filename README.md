# **Plantionary** 
Howdy! 
<br>
<br>
This is a project from The Odin Academy, in which we were to create a landing page. The object was to either create a website similar to this or create your own spin on it. I decided to create my own spin so that I would get the opportunity to learn things outside of what was taught up till this project

# Motivation
I've created basic landing pages before, however, the flex-box technique was quite new to me. It was super exciting to learn such a technique and to have a project utilizing this was thrilling. At first, I had a really hard time figuring out exactly what I wanted the landing page to revolve around. I had recently purchased a houseplant book titled ***PLANTOPEDIA*** which was the inspiration of the website name and how I was going to design the website.
<br>
<br>

# Page breakdown
A thorough breakdown of the content of each page.
<br>
Each page consisted of the logo ***PLANTIONARY*** and the following navigation bar links:
<br>
1. ***ABOUT*** 
2. ***PLANTS***
3. ***CONTACT***  

The pages consisted of different backgrounds and a different layout. As this was a tiny project from The Odin Project, I didn't want to invest too much time trying to perfect the page. As I felt that the more I progress through the course, the more my coding and vision would improve. 
<br>
<br>

## Home Page
The home page was similar to the template provided by The Odin Project. The goal was to create a visual appealing landing page that fit the plant theme while following the layout of the project. I utilized Google's free font [DM SERIF DISPLAY] (https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=DM+Serif+Display") as the prime choice. The typefont provide clean yet round edges that really popped out on the page and was a perfect fit for a plant theme website (remeniscent of a plant).  
<br>

Originally, there was no background color set on the navigation bar so it was the logo and navigation links floating directly on the background image. The navigation links had a background with the opacity set to low `background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255, 0.1)` so the links were more visible on the background. However, it wasn't appealing, so I opted for a more neutral white navigation background that appeared to blend close with all of the pages background image.  
<br>

## About Page
The about page was really a testing page. It provided the viewer the inspiration behind the making of this website. It depicts the household book ***PLANTOPEDIA*** and a clickable link that sends the user to an amazon page to purchase the book.  
<br>

## Plants Page
The sole purpose of the plant page was to recreate the 4 flex items displayed in The Odin Project's template. It utilized three plant images with Lorem Ipsum filler paragraphs. Plants consisted of:
1. Peperomia - most, if not all, are non-toxic to pets
2. Monstera - pretty much all toxic to pets
3. Anthurium - same as the Monsteras  
<br>

## Contact Page
This was a really difficult page to figure out. The layout was the most difficult as I've personally never created a contact page before. I looked at many inspirations and only one really caught my eye ![contact page example](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3edabd_4ab0648779e6445ab97275c98203158d~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1000,h_571,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/3edabd_4ab0648779e6445ab97275c98203158d~mv2.png). The only problem that I faced was the background image was not a blank page, thus implementing an image on top of the background image would not have been the best route to go. As of right now, I left the page as is.  
<br>

Originally, I create a button function for the "Contact Us" however I was facing difficulties on making it clickable. So I opted for a link that looks like a button. I made the link transition from a black background to a white background via hover property and utilizing the code `transition-duration: 0.4s` to create the speed and change in color of the link as the user hovers over it. 
<br>

# Improvements
There is always improvements that can be done, especially someone who is at my level (novice). I am personally glad that I went for a plant theme, however, some of the changes/improvements that I personally think that I could of done.  
<br>
- Background Images  
I think I didn't necessary needed to change the background image for each page nor even have background image. Personally, I felt that with solid color backgrounds (muted, pastels, etc...) would offer more opportunities to get creative in terms of layout. As the background images would interfere with the font colors and I didn't want to have to change the font colors for each page and detract from the consistent theme that I was trying to go for.
- Color Palette  
The utilization of black font was only used. While it was consistent, it provided for a very plain website. While I wanted to utilize more font colors, I felt the use of the background images really inhibited the use of various colors. I could of used contrast and complementary coloring to provide a more vibrant website.
- Typefont  
Utilizing more than one typefont would of provided some more emphasis to the overall website layout and visual appearance.
